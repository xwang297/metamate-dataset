# MetaMate-Dataset
This repo stores the dataset used in the paper "MetaMate: Large Language Model to the Rescue of Automated Data Extraction for Educational Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses".

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of 32 empirical studies focused on interventions designed to enhance learner autonomy. These studies, which include both journal articles and dissertations, were sourced from a meta-analysis project led by a researcher from Johns Hopkins University, School of Education. The meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions on improving learner autonomy outcomes, and all included studies had at least one treatment condition and one control condition. The study subjects were students from various educational stages, including K-12 and higher education, and the studies originated from diverse education systems, such as Asian, European, Middle Eastern, and North American contexts. The subject areas of the studies varied, with a focus on fields such as language learning and STEM.

We identified 20 data elements from the Participant and Intervention categories within the PICO framework, comprising 10 participant-related data elements and 10 intervention-related data elements. Please find details in [`[coding_scheme.pdf]`](coding_scheme.pdf).
